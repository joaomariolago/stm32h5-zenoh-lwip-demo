# Zenoh-Pico & LWIP with STM32H5

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate **Zenoh-Pico** and **LWIP** with an **STM32H563ZI Nucleo board**. The project uses **STM32CubeMX** to generate initialization code, **CMake** as the build system, and **GitHub Actions** for automating builds and firmware releases.
